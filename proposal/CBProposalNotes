Here's what CB had to say:

1. Make sure to give him any receipts so we can get our money back.

2. On the proposal:

"For revision please expand each of these into a paragraph
pr two - with examples, restrictions, etc. I like this project since it can
grow."

3. On the separate sheet:

Whiteboard

Good proposal. For revision I'd like much more detail in the  features
listed in section 6.  This would be good for you, too!

I think this is close to an ideal project since all the features
(except maybe the elegance and beauty design and creation parts) can
have minimal functionality to demonstrate the system as a whole.

To me that means y'all should concentrate on the system design first,
and I didn't see much about that.  So for revision would be
good to have some detailed planning for the organization of the
parts, what the glue looks like.  In my experience, systems
integration
is often much harder than one things, and your advantage is that you
can tackle that issue right now (I think).  And if not, knowing why
not is important.

It could still be that this is too ambitious a plan, so I'd recommend
thinking how functionality can be faked or pared back (this is
consistent with what I said above), or maybe dropped altogether if
the underlying system gets too involved, which I'm thinking  it might.

A flow-diagram illustrating the workings of the system and its
relation (beginnings of interface specs) to the separate
functionalities
would be good in the revision.

So revision should give more attention to
functionality details, system design, fallback positions, and be
much more explicit about who is doing what by when.
