\section{Background}

A Learning Management System(LMS) is an interface between students and
professors. The most popular LMS, especially at colleges and universities, is
Blackboard. Blackboard, however, is extremely slow and has unnecessary and
fairly unused features. For example, their discussion boards, and personalize
page features are rarely if ever used. Blackboard and other similar services
trade speed for extra features. This also makes them difficult to navigate.
For example, Blackboard has two sets of navigation tabs, and it is not obvious
what the difference between them is. Our website will do the opposite, relying
on the reasoning that students today would rather get what they need quickly,
than have a hundreds of features they rarely if ever use.

\section{Goal}

The goal of Whiteboard is to create an open-source Blackboard alternative that
is simple, efficient, and intuitive to use. The most important goal is for the
site to have a unified user experience. It shouldn’t take a computer science
major three days to find where the grades are posted, and even then to be
confused about what their grade is. (We also shouldn’t have to Google
“university of rochester blackboard login” to log in to Blackboard. We should
be able to be directed from the home page of the website.)

\section{Budget}

For this project we shouldn’t need a big budget. The only thing we need to
spend money on is for server space to host the website, but we are planning to
get server space on the computer science servers to save money. If we can’t get
server space on the computer science server, then we shouldn’t spend more
\$10/month on hosting.
