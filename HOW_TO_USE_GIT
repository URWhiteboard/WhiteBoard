For those who aren't familiar with git (not really sure who is/isn't):

Basically never edit on the master branch. Instead, create a new branch, edit
on that, and then submit a pull request (If you don't know how, just Google it;
nothing should be hard to find). The idea is that the master branch should only
have woking code, not development code. You can do all of this on github.com,
or on your computer using git if you have it downloaded.

I've created a proposal branch for working on the proposal.

I've also created a site branch for working on the site, to keeo that work
separate.

(Yeah so this didn't really say how to use git/github, but that's easily
Googlable. I'd just like branches to be used so the code on master always
works.)
