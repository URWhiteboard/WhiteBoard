For those who aren't familiar with git: you basically never want to edit on the
master branch. Instead, create a new branch, edit on that, and then submit a
pull request (If you don't know how, just Google it; nothing should be hard to
find). The idea is that the master branch should only have 100% woking
code, not development code. You can do all of this on github.com, or on your
computer using git if you have it downloaded.

I've created a proposal branch for working on the proposal.
