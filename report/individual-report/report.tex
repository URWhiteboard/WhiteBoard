\section{Quantitative}

\subsection{Hours}

On average, I think I spend 2 hours per week on this project. However, I'm
horrible at estimating time, so this estimate could be way off in either
direction.

\subsection{Commits}

Not including merge commits, I have done 69 commits so far that have gone into
the master branch.

\subsection{Lines of Code}

I have written approximately 7792 and removed approximately 7804 lines of code.
This is mostly based what Github has recorded, with some manual adjustment as
necessary.
