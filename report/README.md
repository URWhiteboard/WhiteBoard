Progress Report
===============

This could be due on Friday! We really need to work on this. Check out directory
cb/ for CB's notes on our proposal, revised proposal, and what we need to do
for this progress report.

Basically, even though this is called a progrss report, it's really version 3.0
of the proposal. This time we really need to make it good.

Proposals
=========

The proposal is tag v1.0, and the revised proposal is tag v2.0, if you want to
access them.
